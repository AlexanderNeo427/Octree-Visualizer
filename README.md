# Octree Visualizer

Demo Video [Here](https://youtu.be/eF0pfnKq1GU)

Visualisation of an Octree, a hierarchical data structure commonly used in Game Development, by sub-dividing/partioning 3D space into a hierarchical tree of grids and sub-grids. 
Commonly used to improve efficiency of things such as:
* Spatial queries (k-nearest neighbours, proximity searches, collision detection....)
* Frustum/Occlusion Culling
* Pathfinding 
* Raycasting/Raytracing 
  
Each Octree node is colored differently depending on it's depth within the tree.
